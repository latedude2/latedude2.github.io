            <h2>First person puzzle game (WIP)</h2>
            <p> The development of Temple of Starlight started as a university project, but is now being developed further with a planned release on Steam. 
                For this project, I am acting as team lead doing both programming and game design work.

                <p>The game was designed to teach Additive Color Theory. The player creates an understanding of how colors mix as they progress though the game due to the design of the game mechanics.  
                    I worked the light detection system, making sure it is optimized well. A lot of effort was put in to ensure the code was easy to both use and change. 
                    I also worked on other parts of the game such as physics interactions, player movement and UI. </p>
