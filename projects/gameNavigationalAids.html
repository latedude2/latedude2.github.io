            <h2>Game Navigational Aid Research</h2>
              <p>I worked on a research project looking into navigational aids’ effect on cognitive map creation of video game environment together with 5 other students. 
                For this project, I acted as the team lead, planning the work schedule, 
                splitting tasks and also taking big parts of the technical implementation. </p>
              <p><b>Technologies used: </b>C#, Processing, Python, Unity, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas and various others.</p>

                        alt="Image 2" />
                  <p>I was responsible for a big part of the programming for this project. I also setup the navigation system and optimized the performance of the game. 
                    A lot of effort was put in into optimization because the size and design of the level were hard to optimize for. </p>

                        data-title="Image 2" 
                        alt="Image 2" />
                  <p>I wrote a Processing application to visualize the paths the players were taking through the level. 
                    This tool was necessary to ensure that the data collected from the test participants was valid. 
                    And hey, it looks pretty neat. </p>

                        alt="Image 3" />
                  <p>I was responsible for the quantitative data analysis for this project. 
                    It included choosing the correct analysis tool and applying it using Python. 
                    The results showed that there was no significant difference between using an NPC or an Arrow as the navigational aid for the creation of a cognitive map of the game environment. </p>
