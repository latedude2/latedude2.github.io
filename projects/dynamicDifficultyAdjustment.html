            <h2>Multiplayer First-person Shooter Game Featuring Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment</h2>
            <p>Bachelor project developed by me and 5 other students at Aalborg university.
            For this project, I acted as the team lead and programmer. 
            We developed a Unity game which features multiplayer implemented using Photon Unity Networking, first-person shooter gameplay and data collection.
        </p>
            <p><b>Technologies used: </b>Unity, C#, HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas and various others.</p>

                <p>Learning how to use the Photon Unity Networking was the biggest challenge for this project. 
                    Putting multiple players into a single game was a very interesting and sometimes frustrating task. </p>

                <p>One of the goals we raised for this project was to enable testing which the participants could do with zero hand holding from us. 
                    The dream was to have a single link that the participants would click and everything else would be automatic. We managed to make this dream a reality! </p>

                <img src="/images/mibreitGallery/image-placeholder-transparent.png"

                    data-title="Image 3" 
                    alt="Image 3" />
                <p>This dream was made possible by creating a WebGL build of the game;
                    doing a bunch of work to collect their data directly from the game;
                     including surveys into the website and finally combining all of these things into a seamless user friendly experience. </p>

                    data-title="Image 4" 
                    alt="Image 4" />
                <p>I also helped to develop and test the DDA system which balanced the game difficulty between the players in realtime.</p>
